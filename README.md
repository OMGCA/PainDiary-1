# PainDiary
An Android application allows you to record your pain information.

Weather information is extracted from OpenWeatherMap.

Map information is extracted from MapBox.

Replace "USE YOUR OWN KEY" with your own API keys from these two sites to make this application functioning.

This project is a part of university's assessments.
